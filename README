# Handwritten Digit Recognition Web App using ANN

An interactive web application that allows users to draw handwritten digits on the screen and predicts the digit using a trained deep learning model built with Keras and TensorFlow. The app is deployed locally using Streamlit and provides real-time predictions.

# Features

Draw digits directly on the browser

Real-time digit prediction using a neural network

Displays prediction confidence

Simple and intuitive UI powered by Streamlit

Trained on the MNIST dataset

# Tech Stack

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy

OpenCV

# Trained using:

Optimizer: Adam

Loss: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy

Dataset: MNIST

# Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Palak2811/handwritten-digit-recognizer
cd handwritten-digit-recognizer


2. Create virtual environment & activate
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install streamlit streamlit-drawable-canvas opencv-python

4. Train the model
python train.py

5. Run the web app
streamlit run app.py


Open browser at:

# How It Works

User draws a digit on the canvas

Drawing is resized to 28×28 and normalized

The trained model predicts the digit

The result and confidence are displayed instantly

# Results

Achieves 97.57% accuracy on MNIST handwritten digit recognition with smooth real-time inference.
